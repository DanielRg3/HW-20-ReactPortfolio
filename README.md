# HomeWork 20 "React Portfolio"

## About
In order to use the latest technologies, in this proect we need to recreate our portfolio using **React**.

## Terminal
- npx create-react-app
- npm start
- npm install gh-pages --save-sev (for github pages)
- npm run deploy

## Content
- React app packages
- Public directory for the index.html
- src directory for the components and media directories:
- Components directory for the different sections on my webpage:
    1. about js & css
    1. cover js & css
    1. footer js & css
    1. info js & css
    1. navbar js & css
    1. slider js & css
- Media is allocating my images and videos
- App.js to adminitrate the different section on my components directory

## Learnings
In this project I learned how to work with React in general.
First of all, how the information is going to be administrated. By this I refer to the different directories and which information to place in each of them.
Once I have stablished the different sections I want on my webpage, I learned how to set the information into the different section (e.g. footer section), how to export it and how to importe it at the App.js file.
I learned how to add a video, how to add images {either saved on my media directory or from webpages URLs}, how to create a carrousel and how to set hrefs to my social media platforms.

## Credits
The credit for this project goes to <cite>Re-On Media</cite>; thanks to this tutorial I was able to recreate the information into my project.
Also, I would like to thanks my TA <cite>Fer Sosa</cite> for helping me to understand some final questions I got.
